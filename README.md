Testing out and learning different Programming Languages. 

This is my first python program after learning some variables and lists.

Started with the basic multiplayer/couch co-op. Creating lists and updating it. 
Next I wondered how to implament sound or music into the game. The first song put into the game was by 2Cellos as it was the only thing on my computer.
Upgraded that to an Ai generated song made by my friend Bergie.

After that was implamented I wanted to make an "AI" that a user could p lay against.
I threw the original code into a function and created a menu that would call a new window when the users selected multiplayer and added the 3 ai buttons. 




made the exe with 
 pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "Tic-Tac-ToeInstra2.mp3;." "path to the main file"
